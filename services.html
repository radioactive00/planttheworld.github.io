         <p>Plant and equipment maintenance. Maintenance on plant and equipment is carried out to prevent problems arising, to put faults right, and to ensure equipment is working effectively. Maintenance may be part of a planned programme or may have to be carried out at short notice after a breakdown. </p> 

         <h1 class="page-title">Purchases</h1>
         <p>Examples of plant assets include land, land improvements, buildings, machinery and equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, leasehold improvements, and construction work-in-progress. Plant assets are also referred to as fixed assets and/or property, plant and equipment.</p>

         <p>When people think of a plant nursery, the local garden center usually comes to mind. Fact is, most garden centers produce very few of the plants they sell. Instead, they purchase their plants from specialty nurseries, who actually grow the plants. </p>
